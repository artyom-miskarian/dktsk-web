After years of nomadic gatherings across Armenia's landscapes, dk.tsk finally has a permanent space. This opening night marks a new chapter, bringing together the community that has grown since 2019.

The evening featured immersive sound installations, live performances, and a celebration of everything dk.tsk has become—and everything it will be.`,

    description: `An annual pilgrimage into the Armenian highlands. Mountain Frequencies 2023 brought together artists and listeners in Dilijan's ancient forests for 12 hours of continuous sound.

Starting in the golden afternoon light and stretching into the starlit night, the gathering moved through ambient soundscapes, deep electronics, and energetic peaks—all powered by the mountain air and collective spirit.

This was dk.tsk at its essence: music, nature, freedom.`,

Studio Sessions strips away the spectacle to focus on what matters: sound, space, and shared experience. Artists perform in the studio environment, blurring the line between live set and production session.`,

No lineup, no poster, no expectations. Just sound, space, and freedom.`,
